  abstract = {Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational
	models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based
	control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency
	of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second,
	a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus
	conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and
	plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return,
	the process by which the currently attended location is prevented
	from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment.
	Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational
	challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control
	attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly
	constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these
	five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological
	understanding of visual attention.},
